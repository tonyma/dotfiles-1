go-coverage.txt: plugin to show the coverages for the Go programming language

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                     *go-coverage*

go-coverage.vim is a Vim plugin to show the coverages for the Go programming
language.

This plugin is extracted from
[gopher.vim](https://github.com/arp242/gopher.vim). See `LICENSE`.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                *go-coverage-commands*

:GoCoverage [flags]                                              *:GoCoverage*
        Run `go test -cover` and highlight lines reported as covered and
        uncovered.

        [flags] are passed to the `go test` command; there are two special
        flags:

        clear        Clear all existing highlighting.
        toggle       Toggle display of highlighting.

                                 *hl-goCoverageCovered* *hl-goCoverageUncover*
        Note: it's impossible to highlight the background with a colour that
        is guaranteed to work well with all colour schemes. The default is to
        use something that works well with the default one and – hopefully –
        most common ones.

        Override the goCoverageCovered and/or goCoverageUncover highlight
        groups if the defaults don't work well for you.
